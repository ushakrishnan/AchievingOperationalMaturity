# ml-llm-platform

## Overview

The **ml-llm-platform** project is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and managing Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Model (LLM) applications. This project encompasses various components including data ingestion, model training, serving, monitoring, and operational governance, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to facilitate the end-to-end workflow for ML and LLM applications, leveraging modern tools and practices to enhance productivity and efficiency. The platform is structured to support various cloud environments and can be customized to meet specific organizational needs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **infrastructure/**: Contains Terraform configurations and Kubernetes manifests for infrastructure setup.
- **data-pipeline/**: Includes components for data ingestion, storage, and validation.
- **model-training/**: Houses Jupyter notebooks, fine-tuning scripts, and tracking setups for model training.
- **serving/**: Contains configurations for model inference and API gateway setups.
- **llmops/**: Includes evaluation scripts, prompt logging, and pipeline configurations.
- **guardrails/**: Focuses on privacy and security measures for ML applications.
- **monitoring/**: Contains tools for observability and cost management.
- **agents/**: Includes configurations for various AI agents.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-llm-platform.git
   cd ml-llm-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need to set up a virtual environment and install required packages listed in the respective directories.

3. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   Navigate to the `infrastructure/terraform` directory and apply the Terraform configurations to provision the necessary cloud resources.

4. **Data Pipeline Configuration**:
   Configure the data ingestion tools in the `data-pipeline/ingestion` directory according to your data sources.

5. **Model Training**:
   Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `model-training/notebooks` directory to train your models. Fine-tune models using scripts in the `finetuning` directory.

6. **Model Serving**:
   Deploy your models using the configurations in the `serving` directory. Set up the API gateway for serving model endpoints.

7. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   Implement monitoring tools as outlined in the `monitoring` directory to track performance and costs.
