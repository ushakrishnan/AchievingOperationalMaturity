# Generic ML-LLM Platform

## Overview

The **Generic ML-LLM Platform** provides a comprehensive framework for developing, deploying, and managing Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It includes components for data ingestion, model training, serving, monitoring, and operational governance, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this platform is to facilitate the end-to-end workflow for ML and LLM applications, leveraging modern tools and practices to enhance productivity and efficiency. The platform is structured to support various cloud environments and can be customized to meet specific organizational needs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **agents/**: Contains configurations for various AI agents, such as `crewai` and `langgraph`.
- **data-pipeline/**: Includes components for data ingestion, storage, and validation.
  - **ingestion/**: Tools like Airbyte and Apache NiFi for data ingestion.
  - **storage/**: Configurations for Delta Lake and MinIO.
  - **validation/**: Great Expectations for data validation.
- **guardrails/**: Focuses on privacy and security measures for ML applications.
  - **pii_detection/**: Presidio configurations for PII detection.
  - **prompt_protection/**: Guardrails AI configurations for prompt protection.
- **infrastructure/**: Contains Terraform configurations and Kubernetes manifests for infrastructure setup.
- **llmops/**: Includes evaluation scripts, pipelines, and prompt logging configurations.
  - **evaluation/**: Scripts like `ragas_eval.ipynb` and `trulens_eval.py` for model evaluation.
  - **pipelines/**: LangChain pipeline configurations.
  - **prompt_logs/**: PromptLayer integration for logging.
- **model-training/**: Houses Jupyter notebooks, fine-tuning scripts, and tracking setups for model training.
  - **finetuning/**: Scripts like `peft_lora.py` and `qlora_config.yaml` for fine-tuning.
  - **tracking/**: MLflow setup for experiment tracking.
  - **vector_store/**: FAISS setup for vector storage.
- **monitoring/**: Contains tools for observability and cost management.
  - **kubecost/**: Cost management tools.
  - **opentelemetry/**: OpenTelemetry configurations for tracing.
  - **prometheus_grafana/**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- **serving/**: Configurations for model inference and API gateway setups.
  - **api_gateway/**: FastAPI application for serving models.
  - **inference/**: Tools like Triton and vLLM Server for inference.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generic-ml-llm-platform.git
   cd generic-ml-llm-platform
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may need to set up a virtual environment and install required packages listed in the respective directories.

3. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   Navigate to the `infrastructure/terraform` directory and apply the Terraform configurations to provision the necessary cloud resources.

4. **Data Pipeline Configuration**:
   Configure the data ingestion tools in the `data-pipeline/ingestion` directory according to your data sources.

5. **Model Training**:
   Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `model-training/notebooks` directory to train your models. Fine-tune models using scripts in the `finetuning` directory.

6. **Model Serving**:
   Deploy your models using the configurations in the `serving` directory. Set up the API gateway for serving model endpoints.

7. **Monitoring and Optimization**:
   Implement monitoring tools as outlined in the `monitoring` directory to track performance and costs.
