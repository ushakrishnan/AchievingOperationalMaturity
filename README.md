# Achieving Operational Maturity in ML + LLM Platforms: A Deep Dive into Enterprise-Grade Components

## Overview
This repository contains resources, code, and documentation to help enterprises achieve operational maturity in Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Model (LLM) platforms. It includes infrastructure setup, data pipelines, model training, serving, monitoring, and governance components.

## Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ushakrishnan/AchievingOperationalMaturity.git
   cd AchievingOperationalMaturity
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - For Python components, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For infrastructure scripts, ensure tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform are installed.

3. **Run Tests**:
   Navigate to the `tests/` folder and execute unit and integration tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Known Issues

1. **Dependency Resolution**:
   - Ensure all required Python packages are installed. Missing dependencies can cause import errors.
   - Use `pip install` commands mentioned in individual scripts to resolve issues.
   - For infrastructure scripts, verify that tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform are installed and properly configured.

2. **Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Administrative privileges are required for provisioning VMs or deploying Kubernetes clusters.
   - Ensure the host machine meets the minimum requirements for running virtual machines or containers.
   - Network configurations, such as firewalls or proxies, may block required ports.

3. **Model Serving**:
   - Ensure the model file exists and is correctly formatted before running the serving script.
   - Use the correct API endpoints as defined in the FastAPI application.
   - Verify that the serving environment has sufficient resources (e.g., memory, GPU).

4. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Large datasets may cause memory issues; consider using distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark.
   - Data validation may fail if the schema or expectations are not properly defined.

5. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Ensure Prometheus and Grafana are correctly configured and have access to the required metrics endpoints.
   - Misconfigured alerts or dashboards may lead to incomplete monitoring.

6. **Cross-Version Compatibility**:
   - Components from different versions (e.g., Version 1, Version 2, Version 3) may not be directly compatible.
   - Follow the specific instructions in each version's `README.md` file for setup and usage.

7. **General Troubleshooting**:
   - Check log files for detailed error messages.
   - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set as per the documentation.
   - For any unresolved issues, open a GitHub issue or contact the maintainers.

## Additional Guidance
- **Versioning**: Each version folder (`version1`, `version2`, `version3`) contains a complete implementation of the platform for different stages of operational maturity.
- **Documentation**: Refer to the `README.md` files in each version folder for specific details.
- **Contributions**: Follow the contribution guidelines mentioned above to add new features or fix issues.
