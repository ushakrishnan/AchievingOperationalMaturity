# Achieving Operational Maturity in ML

## Introduction

In this document, we present two opinionated versions of an end-to-end workflow on Azure using Nvidia hardware. **Version 1** focuses on providing full control and customization, allowing users to tailor their infrastructure, data processing, model development, and deployment processes to their specific needs. This approach is ideal for organizations that require granular control over their ML and LLM platforms. **Version 2**, on the other hand, offers a SaaS-like experience with supported platforms and solutions, leveraging managed services to simplify the setup and maintenance of the ML and LLM workflows. This version is suitable for organizations looking for ease of use and quick deployment without the need for extensive customization.

## Key Components for Achieving Operational Maturity

### Infrastructure & Orchestration
Infrastructure and orchestration involve setting up and managing the hardware and software resources required for ML and LLM platforms. This includes provisioning GPU/CPU workloads, setting up DevOps pipelines, and enabling cluster autoscaling. Effective infrastructure and orchestration ensure that the system can handle the computational demands of ML and LLM tasks, scale efficiently, and maintain high availability. Without proper infrastructure and orchestration, the platform may face performance bottlenecks, scalability issues, and downtime, hindering the deployment of production-grade solutions.

### Data Ingestion, Lineage, and Contracts
Data ingestion, lineage, and contracts encompass the processes of ingesting structured and unstructured data, validating schema/data contracts, and tracking data lineage and versions. These components are crucial for ensuring data quality, consistency, and traceability throughout the ML and LLM workflows. Proper data ingestion and lineage management enable accurate and reliable model training and evaluation. Without these components, the platform may suffer from data inconsistencies, lack of traceability, and difficulties in maintaining data integrity.

### Model Development (ML + LLM/SLM)
Model development involves using notebooks and IDEs for model training and fine-tuning, optimizing sparse models, and finetuning LLMs. This component is essential for creating and refining ML and LLM models to achieve high performance and accuracy. Effective model development practices enable rapid experimentation, iteration, and improvement of models. Without proper model development tools and practices, the platform may struggle to produce high-quality models, leading to suboptimal performance in production.

### Model Serving and Inference
Model serving and inference involve deploying models for scalable LLM inference, multi-model serving, and efficient model runtimes. This component is critical for making trained models accessible and usable in real-time applications. Efficient model serving ensures low latency, high throughput, and reliable performance during inference. Without proper model serving and inference capabilities, the platform may face issues with response times, scalability, and reliability, affecting the user experience and application performance.

### Guardrails, Privacy & Governance
Guardrails, privacy, and governance focus on ensuring security through prompt protection, PII redaction, and access control policies. These components are vital for maintaining the integrity, confidentiality, and compliance of ML and LLM platforms. Effective guardrails and governance practices protect against security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and regulatory non-compliance. Without these components, the platform may be exposed to security risks, privacy violations, and legal challenges.

### LLMOps & Evaluation
LLMOps and evaluation involve prompt versioning, observability, experiment tracking, and hallucination detection to monitor model performance and address issues. These components are essential for maintaining the operational health and effectiveness of ML and LLM models. Proper LLMOps and evaluation practices enable continuous monitoring, improvement, and validation of models. Without these components, the platform may struggle to detect and mitigate performance issues, leading to degraded model accuracy and reliability.

### Monitoring, Observability & Cost
Monitoring, observability, and cost management include token-level monitoring, resource usage dashboards, and drift detection. These components are crucial for tracking the performance, resource utilization, and cost efficiency of ML and LLM platforms. Effective monitoring and observability practices ensure that the platform operates optimally and within budget constraints. Without these components, the platform may face challenges in identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks, resource wastage, and cost overruns.
